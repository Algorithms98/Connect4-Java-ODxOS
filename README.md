# Connect4-Java-ODxOS
## About
This was the first project for Open Doors x Open Source, a program to help black CS students be successful in tech roles. We had two other games we could have created (Bingo or Battleship). Our group decided to go with Connect Four.

## Rules of the Game
Connect Four is a two player game where the first player who is able to get a match of four either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. The two players alternate turns. You place your play in the board by dropping your disc. The board is a 6 rows, 7 columns. The discs normally come in red and yellow. 

## Our Implementation
We created the game as a computer game where two players play on the same computer. Instead of using a GUI, we decided to have the users interact with the console to play the game.  The 6*7 board, updates with each play. The first player is 'X' and the second player is '0'. For the player to make their play, the program prompts them for which column they would like to place their place. The program will select the lowest row available in the column to place their play.  If the column number they entered is invalid, they will be prompted again. 

There is a menu that allows you to choose to view the instructions, play the game or exit the game. After the instructions are displayed or you finish with the game, you will be prompted again to make a selection from the menu.
